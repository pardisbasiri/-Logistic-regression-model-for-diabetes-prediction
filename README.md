# Logistic-Regression-Model-for-Diabetes-Prediction

My code demonstrates the construction of a logistic regression model to predict diabetes outcomes based on various health-related features.

After cleaning the dataset by removing rows with missing values and outliers, this model achieves a notable accuracy of approximately 0.79 on the testing data. This accuracy value reflects the model's ability to correctly classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic, suggesting that it performs reasonably well in distinguishing between the two groups based on the input features.

# Logistic-Regression-Model-for-Diabetes-Prediction

This code demonstrates the construction of a logistic regression model to predict diabetes outcomes based on various health-related features. After cleaning the dataset by removing rows with missing values and outliers, the model achieves a notable accuracy of approximately 0.79 on the testing data. This accuracy value reflects the model's ability to correctly classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic, suggesting that it performs reasonably well in distinguishing between the two groups based on the input features. The logistic regression model is trained using the cleaned data, and the accuracy of approximately 0.79 serves as an encouraging indicator of its predictive capabilities in assessing diabetes risk.
